#		C - Functions, nested loops


	This is another project in the C-Low-Level-Programming Language



		Author: Oseni Sakariyau Oluwadamilare


	The Script denoting each task functions are given below:

0. This writes a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

    	. The program should return 0.

1.  This writes a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

2. This writes a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

3. This writes a function that checks for lowercase character.

    	. Prototype: int _islower(int c);
    	. Returns 1 if c is lowercase
    	. Returns 0 otherwise

4. This writes a function that checks for alphabetic character.

    	. Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
    	. Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
    	. Returns 0 otherwise

5. This writes a function that prints the sign of a number.

    	. Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
    	. Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
    	. Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
    	. Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

	The Script denoting each task functions are given below:

0. This writes a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

    	. The program should return 0.

1.  This writes a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

2. This writes a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

		   This file will explain what each script does


0. This writes a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.


1. This writes a function that prints a string in reverse.

    	. Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);


2. This writes a function that returns the length of a string.

    	. Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.


3. This writes a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

    	. Prototype: int factorial(int n);
    	. If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
    	. Factorial of 0 is 1

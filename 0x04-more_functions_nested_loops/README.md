	    This file is going to explain what each scripts does


0. This script writes a function that checks for uppercase character.

    	. Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
    	. Returns 1 if c is uppercase
    	. Returns 0 otherwise.

1. This script writes a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

    	. Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
    	. Returns 1 if c is a digit
    	. Returns 0 otherwise.

2. This script writes a function that multiplies two integers.

    	. Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

3. This script writes a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code

4. This script writes a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
    	. Do not print 2 and 4
    	. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

5. This script writes a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

    	. Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
    	. You can only use _putchar three times in your code.

6. This script writes a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

    	. Prototype: void print_line(int n);
    	. You can only use _putchar function to print
    	. Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
    	. The line should end with a \n
    	. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

7. This script writes a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

    	. Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
    	. You can only use _putchar function to print
    	. Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
    	. The diagonal should end with a \n
    	. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

			This file will denotes what each script does per task.


0. This writes a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
		. Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

1. This writes a function that swaps the values of two integers.

    	. Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

2. This writes a function that returns the length of a string.

    	. Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);


3. This writes a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

    	. Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
